This is my personal attempt to get Monterey running on my Asus Chromebook C425. This was followed from https://github.com/meghan06/ChromebookOSX

Make sure to have https://mrchromebox.tech/ setup. Remove the battery BEFORE turning off WP if you don't have the SuzyQ cable. Make sure to push up the silver connector before pulling up the battery cable from the motherboard.

Lastly, make sure to add the Monterey recovery using Dortaniaâ€™s OpenCore guide and format your USB. https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/

Currently not working:

-Audio --Unsupported codec at time of writing.

-Mic --Same as above.

-SDCard Slot

Issues:

-Wireless is not the fastest.


This is a personal project and I will likely continue to work on this in my free time.
